  "page_type": "About",
  "reason": "The page contains detailed information about the management committee, including the president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, and joint secretary, along with their backgrounds, experiences, and roles, which is typical of an 'About Us' or 'About' page.",
  "chunking_strategy": "Token + Paragraph Mapping",
  "reasoning": "This strategy is best for the 'About' page type with lengthy text content, as it allows for mapping of tokens (e.g., keywords, phrases) to specific paragraphs, enabling efficient retrieval of relevant information about the club's management, mission, and activities."
