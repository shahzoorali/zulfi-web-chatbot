  "page_type": "About",
  "reason": "The page contains detailed information about the Hyderabad Polo and Riding Club, including its mission, vision, values, managing committee, and facilities, which suggests that it is an 'About us' page, providing an overview of the organization.",
  "chunking_strategy": "Token + Paragraph Mapping",
  "reasoning": "This strategy is best for the About page type with lengthy text content, as it allows for mapping tokens (key phrases or sentences) to specific paragraphs, enabling efficient information retrieval and organization of content, which is crucial for understanding the club's activities, facilities, and services."
