  "page_type": "Services",
  "reason": "The page provides detailed information about a specific service offered by the Hyderabad Polo and Riding Club, namely the Intermediate Riding Programme, including its features, pricing, and timings, which is characteristic of a services page.",
  "chunking_strategy": "Token + Paragraph Mapping",
  "reasoning": "This strategy is best for the Services page type because it allows for the preservation of contextual information within paragraphs while also enabling the creation of smaller, more manageable chunks based on tokenization, which is particularly useful for detailed service descriptions like the Intermediate Riding Programme."
