  "page_type": "About",
  "reason": "The page contains detailed information about the Hyderabad Polo and Riding Club, including its mission, vision, values, and history, which is typical of an 'About' page, and also has a prominent 'About us' section in the navigation menu.",
  "chunking_strategy": "Token + Paragraph Mapping",
  "reasoning": "This strategy is best for the 'About' page type with lengthy text content, as it allows for mapping tokens (key phrases or sentences) to specific paragraphs, enabling efficient retrieval of relevant information about the Hyderabad Polo and Riding Club's history, mission, and services."
