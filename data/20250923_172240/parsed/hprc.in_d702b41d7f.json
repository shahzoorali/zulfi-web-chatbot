  "page_type": "Banquets",
  "reason": "The page primarily focuses on banquet facilities, menu packages, and event hosting services, indicating that it is a dedicated page for banquets, likely part of a larger website for the Hyderabad Polo and Riding Club.",
  "chunking_strategy": "Token + Paragraph Mapping",
  "reasoning": "This strategy is best for the Banquets page type because it allows for the preservation of contextual information within paragraphs while also enabling the identification of key entities and concepts through tokenization, which is particularly useful for extracting menu items, prices, and event details from the text content."
