  "reason": "The page text describes specific solutions and tools, such as Incede.ai's planning and analytics ecosystem, prebuilt planning templates, and AI-powered analytics assistants, which suggests that it is showcasing the company's products and services, rather than providing general information about the company or its mission.",
  "chunking_strategy": "Token + Paragraph Mapping",
  "reasoning": "This strategy is best for a Products page with detailed descriptive content, as it allows for both semantic understanding at the paragraph level and finer-grained analysis at the token level, enabling effective indexing and querying in a vector database."
