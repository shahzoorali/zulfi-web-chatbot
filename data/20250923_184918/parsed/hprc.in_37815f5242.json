  "page_type": "Services",
  "reason": "The page provides detailed information about the swimming pool facilities, services, and rules at the Hyderabad Polo and Riding Club, including membership options, coaching, and timings, which suggests it is a services page.",
  "chunking_strategy": "Token + Paragraph Mapping",
  "reasoning": "This strategy is best for the Services page type because it allows for the preservation of contextual information within paragraphs while also enabling the identification of key tokens (e.g., service names, prices, and rules) that are crucial for search and information retrieval purposes, particularly in a vector database where semantic understanding is key."
