However, there are a few rules that all instructors would consider universal. Dress Appropriately Depending on what discipline you choose, it is important that you dress appropriately when riding. This doesn’t mean that if you choose to ride western that you need to wear a cowboy hat, but it does mean that you should wear the appropriate boots and close-fitting trousers and shirt/Tshirt. You don’t always need to be in breeches, but you should at least wear clothes that won’t hinder you while riding. The main reason for dressing appropriately is for safety. Flowing shirts that are either too big or not tucked in can become caught on tree branches, saddle horns, arena rails or fences. The last thing you want is to be sitting on a horse and also caught on a fence. It won't be a comfortable position. Boots aren’t just to make you look good. Boots are critical for foot protection. They protect your toes in case the horse accidentally steps on you. They also ensure that your feet stay properly positioned in the stirrups. Never ride in shoes with no heels. (A critical horseback riding rule). Keep Your Hands Light When riding, it’s crucial that you keep your hands light. One of the biggest mistakes that new riders make is to keep their reins tight at all times so that their horse’s mouth is gaping open. Riders that do this are said to have heavy hands and are using their reins to balance rather than sitting deep in their seat and using their lower body for balance. You should never use your hands and the horse’s mouth for balance. This is a critical horseback riding rule. Violation of this rule will cause your horse to equate you with pain. It may also damage the sensitive tissues of the horse's mouth. Keep Your Heels Down and your shoulders back When new riders are in an arena during a horse riding lesson, instructors often remind “Keep your heels down and shoulders back!” Keeping your heels down allows you to balance with your lower body rather than with your hands. Keeping your shoulders back, ensures that you have the proper posture to balance and ride in sync with the horse. Keeping your shoulders back also ensures that you are able to hold your head up and watch where you are going, instead of staring at your horse’s ears. Never Drop Your Reins Your reins are your direct line of communication. It is permissible to keep the reins loose to allow your horse to stretch his neck after a long ride or horseback riding lesson, but you should always have your hands on the reins. Horse Riding Gear Horse riding gear! There is so much of it available! There is a quote that says “horses are like potato chips, you can’t have just one.” If riders can’t just have one horse think of all the possibilities for gear! What a horse and rider need is all inclusive and can be done with style from head to toe. You should have the minimum attire of Jeans & Boots that have a heel. HELMET First, a specially made and approved horseback riding helmet should be on every riders’ head when mounted for safety. There is no reason not to have this essential piece of horse riding gear as they come in many lightweight and affordable options to every type of rider. Horse riding for beginners also should include a certified helmet that is made for riding horses. Skill level should NOT be a factor when deciding to wear a helmet. WHIP Horse whips or riding whips are artificial aids used by equestrians while riding, driving, or handling horses from the ground. There are many different kinds, but all feature a handle, a long, semi- flexible shaft, and either a popper or lash at the end, depending on use. Riding whips rarely exceed 48\" from handle to popper, horse whips used for ground training. BREECHES RIDING PANTS Breeches fit snug on your body. They tend to be made from cotton or other materials combined with some spandex to help them fit. These Breeches keep you from sliding around on a smooth leather saddle.Traditionally they are worn at the natural waist and are fitted at the bottom (so eld or tall boots can t over them). No shorts or Capri's should be worn because the skin on your legs will get rubbed raw by the saddle as the horse moves. TSHIRT From western T-shirts to the traditional english T-shirt there are options galore in this category. Many schooling T-shirts and even some newer show T-shirts are now made from wicking, breathable performance fabrics. ere is no reason to roast in the summer and freeze in the winter. CHAPS Chaps are a great addition to your horse riding gear. They can give you more grip in the saddle as well as keeping your legs dry from the sweat of your horse or the outside elements. Getting a pair that has the proper fit needs to be at the top of your list with this bit of horse riding gear. Half chaps are an English version commonly used for schooling or lessons. They connect under your shoe and zip or snap up and end at the knee. HALF CHAPS Protective gear worn on the lower leg from the ankle to just below the knee. They provide additional grip and protection while riding, preventing chafing and offering support to the rider's leg. Made from materials like leather or synthetic fabric, half chaps are typically used with paddock boots to simulate the feel and function of tall riding boots, ensuring comfort and safety during equestrian activities. BOOTS Do you love cowboy boots? Or are you more of a paddock boot person? Many times the style you ride dictates what the appropriate ‘horseback riding boots’ are! Western riders typically wear cowboy boots, and english riders tend to like paddock (shorter) boots for schooling or eld (taller) boots mainly used for showing. ere are even lightweight boots that look like sneakers or hiking boots made for the endurance rider or those who don’t like the traditional choices. Do not wear open toed shoes. You definitely don’t want a hoof with a metal shoe on it that transmits several hundreds of pounds of pressure on your bare foot. Ouch! You are best to have something with at least a 1” heel and good traction on it to help keep your foot from sliding around in the stirrup. They will protect your toes on the ground. GLOVES Horse riding gloves can be used for show or schooling and help with grip on the reins. SOME DO’S AND DON’TS OF TRAIL RIDING DO'S DO maintain a safe distance between your horse and the one ahead. DON’T be a dead weight on your horse’s back. DO change position occasionally. (Some riders will stand up briefly to give their horse some relief). DO tie a red ribbon in his tail as a warning. Remember that a kicker is an undesirable choice for trail use, and you will be responsible for any problems he causes. DO mount and dismount on the uphill side. It is wise to practice mounting and dismounting from either side at home before a cross-country ride. DO stay behind the Trail Boss unless he or she has indicated otherwise. DO be as considerate of your horse as you are of yourself. DON’T DON’T ride up too close behind another rider. Your horse may step on the lead horse and pull his shoe off or injure him, and you or your horse could be kicked. If your horse has a tendency to be cranky and/or a kicker, DON’T ride him so close to the group that others are in danger. DON’T pass the Trail Boss (the leader of the ride). It is a matter of good trail manners; besides, though you may think you know where the ride is going, you may not. It is annoying to have to call riders back when they have taken a wrong turn in the trail. DON’T pass other riders at a gallop. You may upset many horses as you speed by. It is especially unnerving to those riding young or green horses that could become extremely excited. You could cause a serious accident. DON’T sit to one side in the saddle. You will be gouging your horse in the back. DO sit up straight with your weight evenly distributed. DON’T leave litter or garbage in the riding area. DO carry out with you what you carry in. DON’T lag behind the other riders. Most rides have a drag or safety rider. If your slow pace holds him back to the point he/she loses sight of the riders ahead, and if the area is so frequently used that tracking is di cult, you could be the cause of the group becoming separated. DON’T be a chronic complainer. All the comforts of home will not be available on the trail. TIPS TO KEEP YOU SECURE IN THE SADDLE Riding is a lot more about balance on the move than gripping with your legs Try to sit squarely in the saddle, moving your body with your horse. The tenser you are, the more you will bounce. Stay in tune with how he is moving. It will be less likely that you will be to be thrown o balance. For beginners we tend to tell them to sit near their back pockets but without slouching the upper body. Having your weight set further back will help keep you secure if the horse stops suddenly. ink of driving in a car without a seat belt. If the driver suddenly hits the brakes you’ll go ying forward. Same thing on a horse except you won’t have the seat belt to keep you in the saddle! The same is true if you are sitting too far back on the horse, if he heads off quickly you’ll be left behind. Always look where you are going Horses are very intuitive. They feel the slightest movements and are also great at reading our intentions. So look up where you want to go and it will help you guide your horse there along with your leg and rein aids. The ball of your foot (the widest part behind your toes) should be where your foot sits on the stirrup You don’t want to have your feet any further than that or you risk getting hung up in case of a fall. Point your toes to the sky while riding. Hold your reins evenly and don’t have too much slack in them How you hold the reins will vary whether you are riding English or Western. Western Riders hold their reins in one hand and don’t have contact with the horses’ mouth because there is a small bit of slack or loop. Western beginners tend to hold the reins too long making it difficult to make a correction with them if needed. English riders hold the reins in two hands and with more contact or feel on the reins. Beginner English riders can tend to use the reins to keep their own balance by hanging on them. This ends up hurting the horses‘ mouth as your hands bounce all over the place with the weight of your body too. If you are riding English, you will need to do your best to keep your body balanced with your hands level and still. Don’t forget to breathe while you are riding! Beginners have a tendency to hold their breath especially as the horse moves up in speed and gait. This can give you a side ache, back ache and transmit emotional tension to your horse. ON THE GROUND You’ll always greet your horse on the ground first, so knowing appropriate ground handling skills is essential for your safety. Since horses are so big and sometimes can be unpredictable, you’ll want to know the following: Do as Horses Do When introduced to your horse offer the back of your hand to him to smell. That is called a “horseman’s handshake” and it is how horses greet each other. It seems like a small thing but in the horse world it is a proper introduction. Beginners have a tendency to hold their breath especially as the horse moves up in speed and gait. This can give you a side ache, back ache and transmit emotional tension to your horse.
