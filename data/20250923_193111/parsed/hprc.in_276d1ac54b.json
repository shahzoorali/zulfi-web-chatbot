  "reason": "The page provides detailed information about the sauna facility, its features, rules, and etiquette, along with pricing and membership details, indicating it is a service offered by the Hyderabad Polo and Riding Club.",
  "chunking_strategy": "Token + Paragraph Mapping",
  "reasoning": "This strategy is best for the Services page type because it allows for the preservation of contextual information within paragraphs while also enabling the creation of smaller, token-based chunks that can be efficiently indexed and searched in a vector database, facilitating accurate retrieval of specific services like sauna facilities or riding programs."
