Arena Polo – The 20-20 version is played in a smaller arena with a small air-filled ball and requires only 3 players per team. This involves more manoeuvring and shorter plays at lower speeds. The modern game lasts roughly two hours and is divided into periods called chukkas (occasionally rendered as \"chukkers\"). Apart from being among the oldest polo clubs, Hyderabad Polo & Riding Club is also authorised to professionally train people in polo. So if you have always had a knack towards trying out this sport, there’s no place like HPRC to get some hands-on training. You can avail a variety of polo courses and training programmes, and also club memberships so that you can access the lush greenery for a match or just a horse ride along with the club facilities. We offer individual and group polo lessons for both adults and kids. Our top-notch instructors will ensure you learn the skill of the sport and will also pair you with the perfect Academy pony.
