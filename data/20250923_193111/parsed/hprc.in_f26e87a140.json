  "page_type": "About",
  "reason": "The page contains detailed information about the Hyderabad Polo and Riding Club, including its mission, vision, values, managing committee, and various activities such as riding programs, polo, and sports facilities, which suggests it is an 'About us' type page, providing an overview of the organization.",
  "chunking_strategy": "Token + Paragraph Mapping",
  "reasoning": "This strategy is best for the About page type with lengthy text content, as it allows for mapping tokens (key phrases or words) to specific paragraphs, enabling efficient information retrieval and vector database indexing, while preserving the context and structure of the content."
